# Target setting app  

This app is connected to the repl.it YOPortalApp.  It is a public respository.  

To contribute to the code base you will need to be given permission to access the repository:  

- Join the repl.it
- Create a new branch (name it with your own name)
- make your changes  
- commit and push your branch regularly  
- pull regularly from the repository to get the latest changes  
- let us know when you are ready to merge your work  


# Creating the app:  

- learners designed the app idea, which was then turned into a program design by the project lead (tutor)
each learner was given the requirement for their part of the app (functions are labelled with the learner's name)
- the project lead put the program together and everyone tested the overall program and, having tested their part independently, tested that it worked in the wider code base
- at regular intervals, learners committed their code to the Github repository on their own branch and, when they were confident it was ready to use, created a pull request to ask for it to be merged. Each commit was documented by the learner
- the project was managed on a Trello board, with learners updating cards and adding comments on progress
original contributions to the design of the app were created and stored in shared documents on Google Drive
- Slack is used to share ideas, links to resources, etc
Evidence can be collected from contributions to Github, Slack, Trello, Google drive documents and own portfolios.
